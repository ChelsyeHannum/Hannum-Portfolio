        Hi, hello! My name is Chelsye and I'm 26 years old. I spent the past five years in property management and recently took the jump to change careers to web developing. Before that, in my glory days, I lived in the Netherlands for a year as an Au Pair.
        Click on the picture of Amsterdam above and you can take a peek at my cringe-worthy blog I wrote during my time there. <br>

        <br> I have a dog named Orion (like the constellation, not the lake) and she might as well be my child. She's a terrier mix and runs away just about every week for 15 minutes. Lord help me. She loves everyone and everything and thinks all people
        are her best friend. <br>



        <br> I moved to suburbia for a short time and, although it's not quite the hell I thought it would be, I can't wait to be back in the city. I label myself as "down-to-earth bougie" and these suburbs don't have that down-to-earth feel like Detroit.
        For now I guess I'll just have to deal with all the chain restaurants and yard work being a go-to conversation.
        <br><br>
